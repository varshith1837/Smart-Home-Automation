# üè° Smart Home Automation System

[cite_start]This project is a console-based application for controlling and managing various household devices through a **unified interface** [cite: 16][cite_start], demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** [cite: 17] [cite_start]using **C++**[cite: 17].

[cite_start]The system simulates controls for devices like an **AC, Fan, Fridge, Light, Geyser, and TV** [cite: 18][cite_start], allowing users to monitor and manage these smart home appliances and adjust settings like temperature, speed, and brightness[cite: 18, 20].

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

[cite_start]The application centralizes control of all household appliances [cite: 20] [cite_start]by representing each device as an **object**[cite: 20]. [cite_start]The system is designed for easy **customization and scalability**[cite: 21].

### Object-Oriented Design: Class Structure

The core of the system is built on a hierarchical class structure that leverages OOP concepts:

* [cite_start]**Base Class (`Device`):** Serves as the foundation for all devices[cite: 33, 261]. [cite_start]It contains common attributes such as **status (on/off)** [cite: 34] [cite_start]and basic methods to turn the device on or off, check its status, and perform universal functions[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Derived Classes:** Each specific device type (AC, Fan, Fridge, Light, Geyser, TV) is represented by a class that **inherits from `Device`**[cite: 33, 262]. [cite_start]These classes include **specialized methods** to handle settings unique to each device[cite: 35]:
    * [cite_start]**AC:** Methods for temperature control, swing setting, and fan speed adjustment[cite: 36, 287, 289, 291].
    * [cite_start]**Fan:** Methods for speed adjustment[cite: 306, 311].
    * [cite_start]**Light:** Methods for brightness and color shade control[cite: 328, 331, 333].
    * [cite_start]**TV:** Methods for channel selection, volume, and brightness control[cite: 349, 352, 355, 356].
    * [cite_start]**Geyser:** Methods for temperature control[cite: 340, 343].
    * [cite_start]**Fridge:** Methods for cooling level control[cite: 317, 322].

### Key Implementation Features

| Feature | Description | OOP Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Encapsulation** | [cite_start]Internal data for each device (e.g., AC temperature, TV channel, Light brightness) is protected and accessed only through designated methods, helping to maintain data integrity[cite: 39, 40]. | **Encapsulation** |
| **Operator Overloading** | [cite_start]The `<<` operator (`operator<<`) is overloaded to allow easy, readable display of device information (status, settings) directly to the console[cite: 49, 50, 303, 315, 326, 338, 347, 362]. | **Operator Overloading** |
| **User Management** | [cite_start]Includes a **Login System** and **Account Creation**, storing user credentials (ID and password) in a **CSV file** for future authentication[cite: 55, 61, 62]. | |
| **Persistent State** | [cite_start]Each user has a **dedicated file** that stores their component data[cite: 90]. [cite_start]When logging in, the previous ON/OFF state and configuration are **loaded**[cite: 92]. [cite_start]The file is updated in **real-time** whenever component states change[cite: 112]. | |
| **Power Tracking** | [cite_start]The device's ON and OFF timings are recorded in a **CSV file** [cite: 172][cite_start], which is used to **calculate energy usage** and estimate the electricity bill[cite: 108, 172, 202]. | |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Login and Setup

1.  [cite_start]**Launch the Program:** Run the program and you will be prompted to log in or create an account[cite: 71, 94].
2.  **Login/Account Creation:**
    * [cite_start]If your ID is found, you are logged in[cite: 58, 97].
    * [cite_start]If your ID is not found, you are prompted to create a new account by setting an ID and password[cite: 59, 61, 73, 74].
3.  [cite_start]**Component Configuration:** New users are asked to specify the **number of smart home components** they own (Fans, Lights, ACs, etc.)[cite: 64, 75, 111]. [cite_start]You may optionally initialize the status and settings (e.g., brightness, temperature) for all your components[cite: 224, 227].

### User Control Interface

[cite_start]After a successful login, the main control menu is displayed[cite: 100, 101, 134, 177, 251].

| Menu Option | Action | Example Device Settings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Turn ON a device** | [cite_start]Changes the device's power status to ON[cite: 102]. | |
| **2. Turn OFF a device** | [cite_start]Changes the device's power status to OFF[cite: 103]. | |
| **3. Adjust device settings** | [cite_start]Allows modification of device-specific attributes[cite: 104, 385]. | [cite_start]Increase/Decrease **Temperature** (AC, Geyser) [cite: 287, 343][cite_start], **Speed** (Fan) [cite: 312][cite_start], **Volume/Brightness** (TV, Light)[cite: 355, 356, 331]. |
| **4. Set timer for a device** | [cite_start]Automates the device to turn off after a specified duration[cite: 105, 386]. | |
| **5. Show device status** | [cite_start]View the current ON/OFF state[cite: 106, 247]. | |
| **6. Show device complete info** | [cite_start]View the complete current configuration (e.g., channel, temperature)[cite: 107]. | |
| **7. Power Bill estimation** | [cite_start]Calculates the energy usage and cost based on logged ON/OFF times[cite: 108, 208]. | |
| **0/9. Exit** | [cite_start]Logs out the user, ensuring the current state of all devices is saved securely[cite: 109, 174, 187, 190]. | |

## üõ†Ô∏è Limitations and Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

* [cite_start]**Limited UI:** The application is **console-based** and may not be user-friendly for non-technical users[cite: 368].
* [cite_start]**Timer Range:** Timer settings currently have a set range, which limits some device automation options[cite: 369].
* [cite_start]**Error Handling:** A check is performed to ensure device status is ON before settings can be adjusted (e.g., "Please turn on the AC first")[cite: 372, 431, 446, 464, 480, 494].

### Planned Future Enhancements

1.  [cite_start]**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Improve usability by replacing the console interface with a GUI[cite: 375].
2.  [cite_start]**Advanced Device Simulation:** Expand functionalities to simulate real-time device responses[cite: 376].
3.  [cite_start]**Remote Access:** Enable remote access to control devices via the internet[cite: 377].
